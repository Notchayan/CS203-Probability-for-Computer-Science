### Bertrand Paradox Simulation

This Python script simulates three different methods for exploring the Bertrand Paradox: random endpoints, random radial point, and random midpoint methods. Each method is presented with interactive visualizations using Matplotlib. Users can select a method of choice and set parameters like the radius of the circle and the number of trials. The simulation provides insights into probability paradoxes and offers a hands-on exploration of geometric probability concepts. This tool is valuable for educators, students, and anyone interested in probability theory and geometric probability.

### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select a method (1, 2, or 3) to explore the Bertrand Paradox.
3. Input parameters such as the radius of the circle and the number of trials.
4. Visualizations will be displayed, showing the simulation results and probabilities.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

### Instructions:
1. Choose a method to explore the Bertrand Paradox by inputting the corresponding number.
2. Follow the prompts to input parameters for the simulation.
3. View the generated visualizations to understand the outcomes and probabilities.
